                        to pay
                        for Your purchase. In case Your order is not serviceable by our delivery partners or the
                        merchant or the
                        area is
                        not covered, we would request You to provide us with an alternate shipping address which we
                        expect to have
                        on
                        our partner/merchant's delivery list. In case there is any dispute regarding the shipment of the
                        product or
                        services for the area not covered by OTTOMOTIV , in such cases OTTOMOTIV will not be

                        would
                        endeavour to ship all Products together. However, this may not always be possible due to some
                        product
                        characteristics and/or logistics' issues. If You purchase multiple Products in single
                        transaction, then all
                        the
                        Products would be dispatched to a single shipping address given by You. If You wishes to ship
                        Products to
                        different addresses, then You should book the orders separately based on the delivery addresses.
